Turkana county in northern Kenya hosts the country’s largest aquifer. Discovered in the Turkana and Lotikipi basins, the aquifer was expected to benefit the local community which comprises nomadic pastoralists. However, 6 years down the line, that is not the case. Initial tests conducted showed that saline levels of the aquifer are seven times higher than considered safe by the World Health Organization (WHO) and, thus, unfit for human consumption. Compounded by other factors, locals have to go for long periods without food and water. What is not happening? Ouma Onyango and his team of fellow cohorts from Africa Uncensored’s investigative journalism training and mentorship programme, #Investigate101, were on the ground in 2018 to find out.
